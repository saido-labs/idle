# idle
idle is a simple stateful stream processing framework

## use-cases
idle hopes to integrate in the following ways:

1. kafka to {kafka, s3, ?}
2. ? to {kafka, s3, ?}

with point #1 as priority.

## notes

## roadmap

- sql queries are parsed on start and baked in as an Eval Tree
- protobuf is supported out of the box
  - how do we specify schemas?
